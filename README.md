# Overview: Data Wrangling

Starting with your *Machine Learning Checklist* you will see that a crucial step is **preparing and understanding** the data. It is a step where you will spend most of your time. 

Here are two example checklists from [Jason Brownlee](https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-checklist/) and [Aurélien Géron](09-17-2018-Machine-Learning-Project-Checklist.txt ) that you can adapt to your needs.                   

During data preparation numerous tasks are performed and good tools are needed.

We will use [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html). Pandas is a Python library for data manipulation, wrangling  and analysis of tabular and time series data. It contains extensive tools designed to make data analysis fast and easy.

**Let's get ready to Wrangle...**
